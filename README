This tool converts GroupWise calendars and contacts to Exchange, using the GW7
SOAP interface and Exchange's EWS SOAP interface.

General use:

  1. Generate an API key for GroupWise.  I used the VBNet_Trusted sample code
     available from http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Tapp_samples.
     You will need the NDK to get gwapp.dll, which just has to be in the
     same directory as the included debug build.  If you can't generate an
     API key, you can modify the login code to use the user's username
     and password.

  2. Put the key information and the various server names into config.yaml.
     Generally speaking EWS should be on your Exchange 2007 CAS server.  This
     tool was written against Exchange 2007, all bets are off if you're on
     something else.

  3. Run the contact-blender.rb or calendar-blender.rb to do the conversion.
     You will need to know the user's AD / Exchange password in this version,
     although I imagine you might be able to modify the code to do it through
     delegation.  If you do, you might need to change the exchange driver to
     include the delegation information.

I've included some scaffolding that helped me figure out the object model,
and a tool to delete everything in an exchange calendar, which was useful for
debugging.
